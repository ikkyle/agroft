Agroft is a free software tool designed to help agricultural researchers running field trials analyze the data they collect. It uses a powerful, free, but complicated scientific programming language called "R" to run all the analyses, but is packaged into an easy to use interface.

Take some time to watch the video below. It will quickly walk you through the main features of Agroft so you have an idea of how to use it and what it can do for you. More detailed information on how to use the specific features of this software are available in the "Using Agroft" section of this webpage.

Agroft is cross-platform software. It can run on Windows, OSX, and Linux platforms. To run Agroft, you will need to first install R and, if you use Windows, a helper program called Rtools. See the next section, "Installation", for more information on this.
