load.data.explanation : >
  The R code needed to read in your data will appear here. If you have selected
  "use sample data instead," you will be given the option of selecting from a
  number of datasets available to R users. These datasets provide an easy way to
  explore different data analysis techniques.
var.type.info : >
  Numeric variables are any variables that are measured on a continuous scale.
  Yield is a common numeric variable. Grouping variables are variables with
  different levels. These levels do not convey information on a continuous scale
  in the way that numeric variables do. Block, plot, variety, and treatment are
  common grouping variables.
t.test.explanation : >
  t-tests are for testing the difference between the means of two groups. A
  t-test requires a continuous response or dependent variable, such as yield or
  N content
anova.explanation : >
  ANOVAs are for testing differences between more than two groups. A one-way
  ANOVA examines the influence of one categorical, independent variable on one
  continuous dependent variable, such as yield. A two-way ANOVA examines the
  influence of two categorical independent variables on a dependent variable.
  With a two-way ANOVA, it is possible to assess the main effect of each
  independent variable and also if there is an interaction between them. If each
  level of each independent variable is tested against each level of the other
  factor, then this is called a factorial ANOVA
lm.explanation : >
  Linear models and generalized linear models allow you to run a regression.
  Linear models are useful if your dependent variable is continuous. An example
  would be understanding the relationship between pest incidence and yield.
  Generalized linear models are useful for using different distributions. To
  find out more, select "linear or generalized linear model" from the Select
  Analysis tab and click "more info" under the dropdown box asking "What type of
  data is your dependent variable?"
rcbd.explanation : >
  The analysis of a Randomized Complete Block Designs (RCBD) is done using an
  ANOVA. Generally only two independent variables are used in a RCBD, block and
  treatment. If you have used a RCBD but want to include more than just block
  and treatment in your analysis, please select ANOVA instead.
continuous.explanation : >
  If your dependent variable (DV) is continuous, choose "continuous" from the
  drop-down box above. This will run a regression. A common dependent variable
  in regression with a continuous variable is yield.
dichotomous.explanation : >
  If your DV has only two levels, 1 or 0, choose "dichotomous (binary)". This
  will run a logistic regression with the assumption that your DV follows a
  binomial distribution.  This is not a common selection.'
count.explanation : >
  If your DV is a count variable, select "count" to run a poisson regression.
  Disease count in crops is a common "count" variable
t.test.dv : >
  Your dependent variable in a t-test is the continuous variable you have
  measured. A common dependent variable is yield.
anova.dv : >
  Your dependent variable in an ANOVA is the continuous variable you have
  measured. A common dependent variable is yield.
rcbd.dv : >
  When analyzing a randomized complete block design (RCBD), your block variable
  is the variable contaning information on what block each treatment was applied
  to. The treatment variable is the variable that contains information on the
  treatments you have applied in your experiment.
ind.var.explanation : >
  Independent variables are those that are manipulated in order to cause change
  in the dependent variable. Some common independent variables are field, block,
  and treatment, but independent variables vary across experiments.
analysis.code.explanation : >
  This is the code needed to run your analysis. If you have specified that your
  data contains categorical variables (called "factors" in R), first they will
  be converted to this variable type via the function "as.factor." Only after R
  recognizes every variable in the form that you intended, is it advised to run
  your analyses. In R, the first argument when running a t-test, ANOVA, or a
  linear model is the formula. This formula allows you to specify your dependent
  and independent variables, including any interactions between your independent
  variables
fit.explanation : >
  When you clicked "Run analysis," your model was assigned to an object called
  "model.fit." If you type just "model.fit" into R, it will display the
  information it connects to this object. It is very easy to create and delete
  objects in R to assist with your analyses. It is possible to name objects
  anything that helps you remember the information the object contains, for
  example "cotton.T.Test." If you designate that the object "cotton.T.Test" is a
  t-test for your selected variables, then it is as simple as typing
  "cotton.T.Test" into the R console to view the results. If you are running an
  ANOVA or GLM analysis, first assign your desired test to an object such as
  "model.fit" and then print the test results using a function anova(). This
  looks like anova(model.fit).
